This is a fork of XCharts with my own personal changes to enhance functionality for multi-serie charts, especially for financial market graphing.
Changes include:
- Can now show and specify multiple Series in the Data Shadow of DataZoom. (Allowing more than the default of just the first series from being rendered)
- Can now specify cutoffs to tooltip data to prevent unnecessary data from being displayed. (Avoiding visual clutter when enabling multiple serie)
